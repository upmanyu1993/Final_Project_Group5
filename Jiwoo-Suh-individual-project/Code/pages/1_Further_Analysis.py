        ### Further Improvements

        The current implementation of the application has laid a solid foundation, and there are several avenues for enhancement and refinement. The following are key areas for further improvement:

        1. **Performance Optimization through Fine Tuning:**
           - Explore opportunities for fine-tuning the existing model to enhance its performance.

        2. **Exploration of Advanced Models:**
           - Experiment with state-of-the-art models like "llama" and other cutting-edge language models to assess their effectiveness in lyric analysis.

        3. **Multilingual Lyrics Handling:**
           - Extend the application's capabilities to handle lyrics from multiple languages.
           - Investigate alternative models designed specifically for multilingual text processing, allowing the application to seamlessly analyze lyrics in various linguistic contexts.

        4. **Data Enrichment from Lyrics Websites:**
           - Enhance the dataset used for training by incorporating additional lyrics data from reputable sources such as Genius.
           - Regularly update the dataset to ensure that the model remains current and capable of handling a diverse range of musical genres and styles.

        5. **Integration with Text-to-Speech Models:**
           - Investigate the possibility of integrating a text-to-speech (TTS) model to generate speech based on the analyzed lyrics.
           - Enable users to experience the synthesized output in the voice characteristic of each artist, providing a more immersive and personalized experience.

        These proposed improvements aim to elevate the application's performance, broaden its language support, leverage advanced models, enrich the dataset, and introduce innovative features. Continuous exploration and refinement in these areas will contribute to a more robust and versatile lyric analysis application.
