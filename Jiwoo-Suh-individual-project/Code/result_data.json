(Ooh, really, really, really like this) I think I might push my luck with you Did you say that you got nothing else to do? Is it okay if I stay? 'Cause I'm dying to Yeah, I'm dying to Restless, tangled up in your mattress In the morning, I'll pick you up and take you home Say you'll never let me go Yeah, I'll never let you go Deep in my bones, I can feel you Take me back to a time only we knew Hideaway We could waste the night with an old film Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room Hideaway Say what you want, but don't let me say what you want Say what you mean Do you really mean, do you really mean it (In the town full of fancy cars and Crowded bars and supermodels Looks exactly the way it did inside my head when I dreamed about it All the things I could live without"

Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like Oh, you look good in the morning And you don't even know it I knew that I got this feeling on a summer day Knew it when I saw her face I just thought that she could be the one She looks good in the morning But she's been hiding it all along Tell me, how can we keep holding on? Holding on tonight 'cause I've been waiting for the day When things will never ever be the same Locked down 'cause we're already in too deep They lie when they claim we are asleep And all I say is No, I am not mistaken This time, I am sure No, I'm not mistaken Whatever it is, I am sure I am sure Mistaken (Mistaken) Mistaken (Mistake) I am sure Mistake (Mistaken) I am sure Oh, I didn't know that this was gonna be so easy This is gonna be so hard, we got to get to know each other first These are the times that we've been"
